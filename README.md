Datascrappers 

Our website takes a modern approach on advertisement. 
We used the two leading social media platforms, youtube and instagram as a source for our influencers.
Our platform is categorized by country, number of followers an influencer has and what kind of business is being marketed.  
With the world of digital media growing everyday, digital platforms have increased incorporating marketing plans to promote products and services. 
We used a user interface Chatbox where the user chooses the influencer based on the product, area and category of what the business wants marketed.
